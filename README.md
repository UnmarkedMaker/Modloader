# Modloader Framework


---

Modloader framework is a side "project" I did in my free time, feel free to figure out how and where to use it.

With Modloader Framework you can dynamically load an unload special libraries, without execut
ing them. The framework itself is built in Python3, and the modules are by default, in python3, but the framework can be capable of running other types of scripts too.
This project is excelent for building CLI-s, where commands/modules can be added, removed and change very easyly.

## Install
By default [cli.py](./cli.py) is included, [cli.py](./cli.py) can run modules by typing their names. If you want to make custom modules (which is why you are probably here). Read documentation about how to make your own custom modules. 


## Where to start

The full documentation is in the ./docs directory.
The structure of the ./docs directory:
* [mod-how-to.md](./docs/mod-how-tp.md) - The guide for average user on the modules system
* [mod-loading.md](./docs/mod-loading.md) - In depth, technical guide on how modules work
* [console.md](docs/console.md) - How the default console works and how to use it
* [module-standards.md](docs/module-standards.md) - Module making standards

## Todo:
- [x] basic documentation  
- [ ] good documentation  
- [ ] cli helper tools (help, usage)  


## Verify ownership

If somebody shows a string, which's sha512 hash is in the follwing list. He made this projects.
